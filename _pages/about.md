I am currently a final year Ph.D. student at the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk) in Cambridge supervised by Emma Davenport and Leo Parts. My main research interests have been to understand the influence of structural variation on human phenotypes, in particular gene expression, and also understanding the genetic determinants of transcriptional outliers. During my Ph.D., I received an early career award from the European Society of Human Genetics for my research and have co-authored papers in Science, Nature Genetics and the American Journal of Human Genetics. I also worked on developing machine learning methods for drug target identification at AstraZeneca. Prior to starting my Ph.D. I graduate from the University of Oxford with a first class master's degree in Biochemistry. During this time, I conducted research at Princeton University in Professsor Mona Singh's lab and at Oxford in Professor Phil Biggin's lab. 

My major interest is turning breakthrough life science research into companies. During my Ph.D. I worked for [Hummingbird Ventures](https://www.hummingbird.vc) and [Ahren Innovation Capital](https://www.ahreninnovationcapital.com) investing in life science startups. At Oxford, I cofounded the [Oxford University Biotech Society](https://oxfordbiotech.uk) and was the Managing Director of the [Science Entrepreneur Club](https://www.science-entrepreneur.com). I previously was a Community Manager at [Clustermarket](https://clustermarket.com) working to democratise access to lab equipment.
